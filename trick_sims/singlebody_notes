4) Goals and expectations for this project?
5) Order in which I should develop the client? What files first, etc.

Get information from John:
1) Figure out what variables in John's sim his graphics client is grabbing, and map it onto Brittany's sim.
2) Figure out how the data is parsed in John's sim and apply it to Brittany's.
- The core information and data will be there, just under different name and data structures.
3) On the CS interface side: what data is he grabbing, and how is he displaying it in the 3D graphics client.git remote add
